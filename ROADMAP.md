## 🚀 v1.0 (Target: Q1 2025)

### Focus SDK
- Focus model (Transformer or CNN-LSTM)
- Short-window focus scoring (30-60s windows)
- Focus → HSI fusion
- Real-time focus updates (every 60-120s)

### Core Outputs
- Focus score (0.0-1.0)
- Focus labels (focused, distracted, scattered, fatigued)
- Focus trends (increasing, decreasing, stable)
- Cognitive load estimation (low, normal, high)
- Deep focus block detection

### Platform Support
- Python SDK (complete)
- Flutter/Dart SDK (complete)
- Android/Kotlin SDK (complete)
- iOS/Swift SDK (complete)

### Performance Targets
- Inference latency: < 20ms
- Model footprint: < 3MB
- Battery impact: < 0.5%/hr
- Missing samples: < 5% per day
